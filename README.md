# US Representatives

[US Voter Representatives Landing Page](https://williamcrownover.github.io/us-voter-representatives/) - deployed version

## About

 This app helps US voters to be informed about their representatives. By using publicly available civic APIs we created a tool to bring hidden information to curious voters in a non-biased, comprehensible way.
