## Description

This front-end web application aims to help United State voters easily find out information about their house representatives in congress. By using publicly available civic APIs we created a tool to bring hidden information to curious voters in a non-biased, comprehensible way. The two APIâ€™s used are [OpenFEC](https://api.open.fec.gov/developers/) and [ProPublica Congress](https://projects.propublica.org/api-docs/congress-api/). The app also includes a search tool to find your district number using your address input into [Google Civics API](https://developers.google.com/civic-information). The information of a specific congressional representative is displayed as cards: Information, Finance, Supporters, Vote History, and Travel.
